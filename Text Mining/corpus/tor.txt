a bigger island park would take real effort to build a city thats more equitable with a rich communal life is hard work but it needs to be done this and every summer
the toronto island park is a destination for people across the city and the region even before covid19 reduced ferry capacity long lineups were routine despite talks of replacing the ferries years of austerity budgeting have left any plans stillborn
meanwhile a number of city councillors are so eager toclear the encampmentsout of the parks that they voted against the prospect of providing more portable toilets and washing facilities for their inhabitants
its unclear whether the problem with outdoor facilities is just a lack of political will many homeowning city councillors simply dont understand the essential role of parks for most torontonians who rely on parks for open outdoor space
city parks staff should have been ready to open water fountains washrooms and splash pads before the hot weather hit they werent
nearly 50 of torontonians live in apartments and while its not purely a pandemic phenomenon during lockdown theres nowhere to go but the park
as thousands lined up for water taxis on the weekend one thing was apparent with the hot weather sending people outside torontos outdoor facilities were not quite ready and not quite adequate alexbozikovic writes
