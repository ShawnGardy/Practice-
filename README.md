# Practice-


It's very Simple, you have to make a URL in markdown referring to your folder/file.

For making a URL in markdown files you use a syntax like this [Text](exampleURL) 
here your Text is the text which will appear in the markdown file and the exampleURL is the URL you want to go to.

A Working Example Will Be Like this [Google](https://google.com).

If you want to refer to a particular file/folder inside your repository you don't need https:// all you need is to provide the path of the folder/file

for example in my repository i have a file named example.pdf inside a folder 
named PDFs so my markdown code will look like this [Example PDF](Practice-/PDFs/ExamplePDF.pdf)
